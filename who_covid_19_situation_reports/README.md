This folder summarizes the confirmed cases from [WHO COVID-2019 situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). WHO defines the confirmed case as "a person with laboratory confirmation of 2019-nCoV
infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. " ([Source](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov))) Therefore, its data on and after Feb 13 should have a huge gap compared with our [daily reports](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).
